- 👋 Hi, I’m @ResearcherKrit, a Human-Computer Interaction Researcher with a unique interdisciplinary background in Computer Science, Informatics, Developmental Science, and Learning Science. 
- 👀 My research is aimed at helping create and evaluate developmentally appropriate socio-technical systems that can support healthy social experiences for youth, particularly young adolescents (typically, 7-14 years), within digital spaces preferably through digital/virtual play.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on Discord Bots, AI chatbots, and socio-technical interventions to promote social and emotional development and prosocial behaviors in youth within interest-driven settings, such as online play (e.g., Minecraft)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating developmentally appropriate technological mechanisms for young people (within online spaces like Discord, but also within games like Minecraft)
- 📫 You can reach me at researcherkrithikajagannath[at]uci[dot]edu OR kjaganna[at]uci[dot]edu
